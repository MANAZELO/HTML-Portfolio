<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Manadsanan Gudsom, or you can call me "Bew". I am from Thailand. My favorite food is Papaya salad or spicy foods. My hobby is hiking and running. I try to work out 4 days a week.</p>

<p>I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, but I became interested in coding after working as a mechanical engineer for two years. So, I started learning coding from Udemy.</p>
